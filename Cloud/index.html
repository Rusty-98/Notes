        <div class="head">Cloud Computing</div>
        <div class="desc">
            The term cloud refers to a network or the internet. It is a technology that uses remote servers on the
            internet to store, manage and access data online rather than local drivers. The data can be anything such as
            files, images, document, audio, video and more. <br>
            There are the following operations that we can do using cloud computing:<br>
            • New appplication and services. <br>
            • Storage, backup and recovery of data. <br>
            • Hosting blogs and websites. <br>
            • Delivery of software on demand. <br>
            • Analysis of data. <br>
            • Streaming videos and audio. <br>
        </div>
        <div class="ques">
            <span>Q-</span>Why Cloud Computing?
        </div>
        <div class="ans">
            <span>Ans-</span> Small as well as large IT companies follow the traditional methods to provide the IT infrastructure. That
            means for nay IT company, we need a Server room that is the basic need of IT companies.<br>
            In that server room there should be a database server, mail server, networking, firewalls, routers, modem,
            switches, QPS (query per second mean how much queries or load well be handled by server), configurable
            system, high net speed, and the maintenance engineers.<br>
            To establish such IT infrastructure, we need to spend lots of money. To overcome all these problems and to
            reduce the IT infrastructure cost, cloud computing comes into existence.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="head">Characteristics of cloud computing:-</div>
        <div class="desc">
            • <span>Agility-</span> the cloud works in a distributed computing environment. It shares resources among
            users and works very fast.<br><br>
            • <span>High Availability and Reliability-</span> the availability of servers is high and more reliable
            because the chances of infrastructure failure are minimum.<br><br>
            • <span>High Scalability-</span> cloud offer “on demand” provisioning of resources on a large scale, without
            having engineers for peak loads.<br><br>
            • <span>Multi-Sharing-</span> with the help of cloud computing, multiple users and applications can work more
            efficiently with cost reductions by sharing common infrastructure.<br><br>
            • <span>Device and Location Independence-</span> cloud computing enables the users to access system using a
            web browser regardless of their location or what device they use e.g., pc, mobile phone, etc. As
            infrastructure is off site (typically provided by a third party) and access via the internet, users can
            connect from anywhere.<br><br>
            • <span>Maintenance-</span> maintenance of cloud computing applications of easier since they do not need to be
            installed on each users’ computers and can be accessed from different places. So, it reduces the cost
            also.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="head">Benefits of cloud computing</div>
        <div class="desc">
            • <span>Accessibility-</span>anywhere, with any device the improved accessibility does not just input
            employees. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clients and customers can also login to an account and access their
            information as well. This ensures everyone has up to date information weather they are at the office or on
            the go.<br><br>
            • <span>Ability to get rid of most or all hardware and software-</span>
            With cloud computing, you are no longer required to have your own server, cables, network, switches, backup
            generators, redundant routers, and so on.Depending on the cloud provider you choose, they can manage all of
            this for a monthly fee. Reducing expenses is essential in any outsider model and every cloud-based platform
            benefits from this factor alone.<br><br>
            • <span>Centralized data security-</span> when you use cloud computing data backups are centralized in the
            cloud providers data centres, removing the need for individual users or teams to maintain their own backups
            onsite or offsite. This lowers the rise of data loss should anyone backup fail or be destroyed by a disaster
            could provider an restore the data from another copy maintained in their cloud storage which is continuously
            updated with every piece of data added.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Teams can take advantage of cloud security technologies such as data encryption and two factor
            authentication for greater privacy than they would have when relying on their own equipment or servers at
            home or in the office. <br><br>
            • <span>Higher performance and availability-</span>By using cloud computing resources together simultaneously
            you reach greater performance gains than by having your own dedicated server hardware. Cloud computing
            increses input and output operations per second(IOPS).<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloud services also offer high availability because they are distributed across
            multiple Cloud facilities. cloud provider are respinsible for updating cloud systems and fixing bugs and
            security issues in cloud software which is trasparent to end users.<br><br>
            • <span>Virtualized Computing-</span>Cloud computing is perfect for virtualized computer enviroments because
            cloud resources can be allocated instantly to support significant increases in demand so you never
            experience downtime again. with cloud computing your bussiness can expand its capabilities almost
            effortlessly to meet growing demand without increasing staff or capital expenditures.<br><br>
            • <span>Cloud computing is greener-</span>It is a greener technology then traditional IT solutions. By moving
            to the cloud bussiness can reduce their energy consumption and carbon footpirnt up to 90%. Rather than
            having in house servers and software bussiness can use cloud based services to access the same applications
            and data from any computer or device with internet connection. This eliminates the need for bussiness to
            purchase and maintain their own infrastructure.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;If you are looking for a greener more cost-efficient way to deliver your IT services, consider moving to the
            cloud. <br><br><br>
