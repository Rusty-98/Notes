            Blockchain
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
            Blockchain is a constantly growing ledger that keeps a permanent record of all the transactions that have
            taken place in a secure, chronological, and immutable way. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; It can be used for the secure transfer of money, property, contracts, etc. without requiring
            third-party intermediaries such as banks or governments. Blockchain is a software protocol, but it could not
            be run without the Internet.<br><br>
            &nbsp;• <span>Ledger- </span>It is a file that is constantly growing. <br>
            &nbsp;• <span>Permanent- </span>It means once the transaction goes inside of blockchain, you can put it
            permanently in the ledger. <br>
            &nbsp;• <span>Secure-</span> Blockchain places information in a secure way. It uses very advanced
            cryptography to make sure that the information is locked inside the blockchain. <br>
            &nbsp;• <span>Chronological-</span> It means every transaction happens after the previous one. <br>
            &nbsp;• <span>Immutable-</span> It means as you build all the transactions onto the blockchain, this ledger
            can never be changed. <br><br>

            <span>Q- </span>Who Uses the Blockchain?
        </div>
        <div class="ans">
            <span>Ans- </span>Blockchain tech. can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchain is
            as of distributed
            ledger for cryptocurrency. It shows great promise across a wide range of business applications like Banking,
            Finance, Government, Healthcare, Insurance, Media and Entertainment, Retail, Etc

            Need of Blockchain
        </div>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <div class="head">
            Popular Because of the following-
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
            • <span>Time Reduction- </span>In the financial industry, blockchain can allow the quicker settlement of
            trades, It does not take a lengthy process for verification, settlement, and clearance It is because of a
            single version of agreed-upon data available between all stakeholders. <br><br>
            • <span>Unchangable Transactions- </span>Blockchain registers transactions in chronological order which
            certifies the inalterability of all operations means when a new block is added to the chain of ledgers it
            can’t be removed or modified. <br><br>
            • <span>Reliability-</span> Blockchain certifies and verifies the identities of each interested party. This
            removes double records, reducing rates and accelerating transactions. <br><br>
            • <span>Security- </span>Blockchain uses very advanced cryptography to make sure that the information is
            locked inside the blockchain. It uses distributed ledger technology where each party holds a copy of the
            original chain,so the system remains operative. <br><br>
            • <span>Collaboration- </span>It allows each party to transact directly with each other without requiring a
            third-party intermediary. <br><br>
            • <span>Decentralized-</span> It is decentralized because there is no central authority supervising
            anything. There are stander rules on how every node exchanges the blockchain information. This method
            ensures that all transactions are validated and all valid transactions added one by one. <br><br>

        <div class="ques">
            <span>Q- </span>How does Blockchain Work?
        </div>
        <div class="ans">
            <span>Ans- </span><u>•Facilitating a Transaction</u>: A new transaction has been requested for the
            blockchain
            network, where all data that is required to be transferred is double-checked using public and private keys.
            <br><br>
            <u>•Transaction Verification</u>: After that, the transaction is sent throughout the global network of
            peer-to-peer computers, where all the network's nodes will verify the transaction, including whether there
            is enough balance available to complete the transaction. <br><br>
            <u>•New Block Formation</u>: The Blockchain network has multiple nodes and numerous transactions are
            confirmed simultaneously. A block is made up of several memory pools each of which contains all the
            validated transactions at a specific node and the transaction will be included in the memory pool after it
            has been reviewed and confirmed as valid. <br><br>
            <u>•Consensus Algorithm</u>: The nodes that create a block will attempt to add it to the network in order to
            make it permanent, however if every node is permitted to add blocks in this way the blockchain network will
            disrupted in order to address this issue the nodes employ a consensus method to make sure that each new
            block added to the chain represents the single version of information validated by all the nodes ensures
            that only a legitimate block is safely linked to the chain a hash code for that block is generated by the
            consensus method and is necessary for adding the block to the chain. <br><br>
            <u>•New Block Addition</u>: A newly formed block is now set to be added to the chain after receiving its hash
            value and being validated a blockchain is made of blocks that are cryptographically connected to one another
            by the hash value of the preceding block which is included in each block and the open end of blockchain
            receives a new block. <br><br>
            <u>•Completion of Transaction</u>: The transaction is finished as soon as the block is added to the chain
            and
            the data is then recorded there permanently the transaction's information can be accessed and verified by
            anybody. <br>
        </div>
        <div class="head">Attributes of Blockchain-:</div>
        <div class="desc">
            • Though blockchains are typically used to keep the history of cryptocurrency transactions, they also have
            the potential to store other data, such as digital assets or product inventories. <br><br>
            • It has intrinsic value since it offers a reliable safe and quick means of transferring values with minimal
            to no cost. <br><br>
            • Most of the participants in a cryptocurrency are a decentralized network, rather than a single centralized
            authority making the decision based on a cryptocurrency's attributes, like its total supply. <br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="head">
            Benefits of Blockchain-:
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
            • One of the primary benefits of blockchain is that it is open to all, this implies that anybody can
            contribute to this technology, and joining the distributed network does not need permission from anyone. <br><br>
            • It can be used to record data in a decentralized way so that anyone may check the accuracy of the data by employing zero-knowledge proof wherein one party verifies the accuracy of information to another party while not revealing anything regarding the information. <br><br>
            • Since blockchain is a decentralized system with many trusted nodes, data/information recorded using it is
            permanent. This implies that one does not need to be concerned about losing their data since duplicate
            copies are maintained at every local node.<br><br>
            • Because it is not controlled by a single party, blockchain Is regarded as censorship-free. Furthermore, it
            uses the concept of trusted nodes for verification and a consensus algorithm that validates transactions
            using smart contracts.<br><br>
            • Since every transaction is stored on a block linked to others using hashing methods blockchain provides a
            higher level enormously dispersed system, the security of an IoT system can only be as strong as finding the
            weakest link. In this case, blockchain can be used to make sure that the information collected by IoT
            devices is secure and accessible to only the right people.<br><br>
            •<u>Food and Medical industries</u>- Companies may trace their food items products using blockchain technology
            from the time they are harvested or manufacturers until the point at which they are received by consumers.
            Blockchain technology could aid in the creation of a digital certificate for every food product indicating
            where it originated from and where it has been because if any contamination is found and the manufacturer
            decides to return a batch of product due to quality concerns, they may trace the problem because to its
            source. A mechanism like this might be used in other sectors too. It could be used to track pharmaceuticals
            and other common products as well as to confirm counterfeit products by allowing anybody to check to see if
            the item is from a genius and authentic manufacturer.<br><br>
            •<u>Logistics and supply chain tracking</u>- There are numerous advantages to employing blockchain technology to
            track products as they move through a logistics or supply chain network. Firstly, it enables easier
            communication among parties since information is available on a secure public ledger. It also offers
            increased security and data integrity due to the immutability of information on the blockchain. As a result,
            participants in the logistics and supply chain can collaborate more readily and with more assurance that the
            information being sent to them is relevant and updated.<br><br>
            •<u>Non-fungible tokens</u>- NFTs are generally regarded as a means of acquiring ownership of digital art. Due to
            the blockchain’s precluding against information existing in two places posting on NFT on it assures that
            there is only a single copy of digital artwork. White NFTs have many applications, at their vase they are a
            method of transferring ownership over anything that may be represented by data. <br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="head">Blockchain Cryptocurrency-</div>
        <div class="desc">
            • Cryptocurrency is a type of digital asset that is used to exchange value between parties. It uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions control the creation of new units of that currency and verify the transfer of assets. <br>
            • Cryptocurrency does not exist physically.We know that the government prints government currencies like flat currency such as the dollar or yen itself. <br>
            • It means there is a centralized institution that exists and can create thousands or millions or billions more of that currency unlike government currencies like bitcoin, this type of currency is created by the mathematical formulas that make the cryptocurrency work thus, cryptocurrencies use decentralized control which works through distributed ledger technology that serves as a public financial transaction database. Today many different types of cryptocurrencies are available some of them are- <br><br>
            1) <u><span>Bitcoin -</span></u> It is generally known as the first decentralized cryptocurrency. it is created by a network of thousands of specific nodes called miners. <br><br>
            2) <u><span>Litecoin -</span></u> Bitcoin waits 10 min for a transaction block to be processed but Litecoin can do this in a maximum of two and a half minutes. Litecoin does not have a big market cap the price of Litecoin is lower than Bitcoin, but it is a very effective process. <br><br>
            3) <u><span>Z-cash -</span></u> It is a privacy-protecting digital currency that is built on strong science in cryptography. It provides enhanced privacy for its users as compared to other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Here transaction data is kept confidential, which is made possible through zero-knowledge proofs. It allows transactions to be verified without any information about the sender, receiver, and the amount transacted. <br><br>
            4) <u><span>Monero -</span></u> It is an open-source cryptocurrency that focuses on untraceable privacy and decentralization. It is fast private and secure digital cash, which is operated by a network of users. We can use it to buy and sell things and can exchange for other coins or tokens. It uses a special kind of cryptography which ensures that the transaction remains 100% untraceable. <br><br>
            5) <u><span>Dash -</span></u> It is a short form of digital cash. It is an open-source cryptocurrency and is a form of a decentralized autonomous organization that is run by a subset of users, called master nodes. It permits very fast transactions, which are untraceable. <br>

        <div class="head">Smart Contracts- </div>
        <div class="desc">
            Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary’s involvement or time loss.
        </div>
        <div class="head">
            Features of Smart Contracts
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
            • <span>Distributed-</span> Everyone on the network is guaranteed to have a copy of all the conditions of the smart contract and they can't be changed by one of the parties. A smart contract is replicated and distributed by all the nodes connected to the network. <br><br>
            • <span>Deterministic-</span> Smart contracts can only perform functions for which they are designed only when the required conditions are met the outcome will not vary, no matter who executes the smart contract.<br><br>
            • <span>Immutable-</span> Once deployed smart contract can't be changed it can only be removed if the functionality is implemented previously.<br><br>
            • <span>Autonomy-</span> There is no third party involved.<br><br>
            • <span>Customizable-</span> Smart contracts have the ability for modification or we can say customization before being launched to do what the user wants it to do.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="head">
            Application of Smart Contracts
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
            • <span>Real Estate-</span> There is a smart contract to transfer ownership of an apartment once a certain amount of resources have been transferred to the seller’s account. <br><br>
            • <span>Vehicle ownership-</span> Smart contracts can for example enforce vehicle maintenance service every six months; failure of which will lead to suspension of driver's license.<br><br>
            • <span>Government Elections-</span> Once the votes are logged in the blockchain it would be very hard to decrypt the voter address and modify the vote leading to more confidence against the ill practices.<br><br>
