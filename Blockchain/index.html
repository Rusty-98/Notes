        <div class="desc">
            Blockchain is a constantly growing ledger that keeps a permanent record of all the transactions that have
            taken place in a secure, chronological, and immutable way. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; It can be used for the secure transfer of money, property, contracts, etc. without requiring
            third-party intermediaries such as banks or governments. Blockchain is a software protocol, but it could not be run without the Internet.<br><br>
            &nbsp;<span>1-</span>Ledger- It is a file that is constantly growing. <br>
            &nbsp;<span>2-</span>Permanent- It means once the transaction goes inside of blockchain, you can put it
            permanently in the ledger. <br>
            &nbsp;<span>3-</span>Secure- Blockchain places information in a secure way. It uses very advanced
            cryptography to make sure that the information is locked inside the blockchain. <br>
            &nbsp;<span>4-</span>Chronological- It means every transaction happens after the previous one. <br>
            &nbsp;<span>5-</span>Immutable- It means as you build all the transactions onto the blockchain, this ledger
            can never be changed. <br><br>

            Need of Blockchain
        </div>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <div class="head">
            Popular Because of the following-
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
            <span>1- </span>Time Reduction- In the financial industry, blockchain can allow the quicker settlement of trades, It does not take a lengthy process for verification, settlement, and clearance It is because of a single version of agreed-upon data available between all stakeholders. <br>
            <span>2- </span>Unchangable Transactions- Blockchain registers transactions in chronological order which certifies the inalterability of all operations means when a new block is added to the chain of ledgers it canâ€™t be removed or modified. <br>
            <span>3- </span>Releability- Blockchain certifies and verifies the identities of each interested party. This removes double records, reducing rates and accelerating transactions. <br>
            <span>4- </span>Security- Blockchain uses very advanced cryptography to make sure that the information is locked inside the blockchain. It uses distributed ledger technology where each party holds a copy of the original chain,so the system remains operative. <br>
            <span>5- </span>Collaboration- It allows each party to transact directly with each other without requiring a third-party intermediary. <br>
            <span>6- </span>Decentralized- It is decentralized because there is no central authority supervising anything. There are stander rules on how every node exchanges the blockchain information. This method ensures that all transactions are validated and all valid transactions added one by one. <br>
