            The term “Things” in the Internet of Things refers to anything and everything in day to day life which is
            accessed or connected through the internet. <br>
            The system created by IoT has greater transparency, control, and performance.
        </div>
        <div class="ques"><span>Q: </span>How does it work?</div>
        <div class="ans">The entire working process of IoT starts with the device themselves such as smartphone, digital
            watches, electronic appliances, which securely communicate with the IoT platform. The platforms collect and
            analyse the data from all multiple devices and platforms and transfer the most valuable date with
            applications to devices. <br><br>

        <div class="desc">
            • <span>Connectivity-</span> it refers to establish proper connection between all the things of IoT to IoT
            platform it may be server or cloud. After connecting the IoT devices it needs a high speed messaging between
            the devices and cloud to enable reliable, secure and bi-directional communication.<br><br>
            • <span>Analysing-</span> After connecting all the relevant things it comes to real time analysing the data
            collected and use them to build effective business intelligence. If we have a good insight into data
            gathered from all those things, then we call our system as a smart system. <br><br>
