        <div class="desc">
            Big data is data that involves greater volume and variety in increasing velocity. This is also known as the 3Vs of big data. Big data is also known as complex data. The drivers of big data are: <br>
            • The digitization of society. <br>
            • The plummeting prices of technology. <br>
            • Computing through cloud technology. <br>
            • Community-based open-source software. <br>
            • Social media applications. <br>
            • The upcoming Internet of Things (IoT). <br>

            The Architecture of Big Data
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
            • <span>Data Sources-</span> All big data solutions start with one or more data sources, such as relational databases, and real-time data sources, such as IoT devices. <br><br>
            • <span>Data Storage-</span> Data for batch processing operation is typically stored in a distributed file store that can hold high volumes of large files in various formats. This kind of store is often called a data lake.<br><br>
            • <span>Batch Processing-</span> Because the data sets are so large often a big data solution must process data files using long-running batch jobs to filler, aggregate, and otherwise prepare the data for analysis. Usually, these jobs involve reading source files processing them, and writing output to new files.<br><br>
            • <span>Real-time Message Ingestion-</span> If the solution includes real-time sources the architecture must include a way to capture and store real-time messages for stream processing.This might be a simple data store where incoming messages are dropped into and folder for processing.<br><br>
            • <span>Stream Processing-</span> After capturing Realtime messages the solution must process them by filtering aggregating and otherwise preparing the data for analysis. The processing stream data is then written to an output sink.<br><br>
            • <span>Analytical Data Store-</span> Many big data solutions prepare data for analysis and then serve the processed data in a structured format that can be queried using analytical tools. <br><br>
            • <span>Analysis and Reporting-</span> The goal of most big data solutions is to provide insight into the data through analysis and reporting.<br><br>
            • <span>Orchestration–</span> Most big data solutions consist of repeated data processing operations encapsulated in a workflow that transform source data, move data between multiple sources and sinks load the processed data into an analytical data store, or push the results straight to the report or dashboard to automate these workflows we can use an orchestration technology.

            5V's of BigData
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
            • <span>Volume-</span> The name big data itself is related to a size that is enormous. The size of data plays a very crucial role in determining values out of data. Also, whether a particular data can be considered as big data or not, is dependent upon the volume of data. <br><br>
            • <span>Variety-</span> Data in the form of email, photos, videos, monitoring devices, PDF, audio, etc. are also being considered in the analysis application.<br><br>
            • <span>Velocity-</span> It refers to the speed of generation of data. Big data velocity deals with the speed at which data flows in from sources like business processes, applications logs, networks, social media sites, sensors, node devices, etc.<br><br>
            • <span>Value-</span> It is not just the amount of data that we store or process. It is the amount of valuable, reliable, and trustworthy data that needs to be stored and processed.<br><br>
            • <span>Veracity-</span> It refers to inconsistencies, and uncertainty in data that is data, which is available and can sometimes get messy, quality and accuracy are difficult to control. <br><br>

            Big Data technology components
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
            • <span>Machine Learning (ML)-</span> In machine learning, the concepts to make computers learn things by themselves. <br><br>
            • <span>Natural Language Processing (NLP)-</span> It is the ability of a computer to understand human languages as spoken.<br><br>
            • <span>Business Intelligence-</span> It is a technology used for analysing data and delivering actionable information that helps executives, managers, and workers make informal business decisions.<br><br>
            • <span>Cloud Computing-</span> It is the delivery of computing services including servers, storage, and database networking over the internet.<br><br>
